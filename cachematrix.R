## Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly
## (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss
## here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse
## of a matrix.
##
## Write the following functions:
##    
## 1.makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can 
##   cache its inverse.
## 2. cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix"
##    returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been 
##    calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should 
##    retrieve the inverse from the cache.
##
## Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function
## in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.
##
## For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.
## 
## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
##
## Write a short comment describing this function
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    # Creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

    #
    # Returns:
    # The object that can cache the inverse of the matrix.

        # set the value of the matrix and clear the value of inverse matrix

        # in the parent environment.

        message("getting cached data") # notify user
        return(inverse.x) # return inverse matrix
    }
    # Cached value of inverse matrix is not exists. We will caclulate it
    data <- x$get() # Get the matrix to inverse
    inverse.x <- solve(data, ...) # Inverse matrix
    x$setinverse(inverse.x) # Store the result in the makeCacheMatrix object
    inverse.x # return inverse matrix
